# iWork utilities

This project contains a tool for converting Pages files to HTML. The initial motivation was to recover my older Pages
files, but I got carried away and wrote a converter for the current format and the older iOS format.

It is very much a work in progress, but hopefully someone finds it useful.

# Setup process

Download and build

```bash
go get https://github.com/dunhamsteve/iwork/iwork2html
```

# Usage

Export path

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:$(go env GOPATH)/bin
```

Run conventer

```bash
./iwork2html infile.pages outfile.html
```

## Pages '13

I'm building on [the work of Sean Patrick O'Brien](https://github.com/obriensp/iWorkFileFormat) on github. He determined
the base format of the `.iwa` files in the iWork'13 were a snappy compressed sequence of protobuf-encoded records and wrote
[a tool to extract the protobuf definitions from the executables](https://github.com/obriensp/proto-dump). Those `.proto`
files are included in the `proto` directory. He also extracted tables of `int` to `type`, needed to decode the `.iwa`
archives. Those `.json` files are included in this project.

I've used the json files to generate some of the code in the `index` directory. (Using the code found in `codegen`.) I ran
`protoc` on the `.proto` files and cleaned up the results so they would compile.

On top of this, I wrote the `index` package, which loads the database into memory. And I wrote `iwork2html` which will load
a pages file and render the contents to HTML.

## iOS '.pages-tef' files

Before the format change in Pages'13, the iOS version of pages introduced a `.pages-tef` bundle format for iCloud storage.
It turns out that the sqlite database within these bundles mirror the '13 format. The `iwork2html` program handles these
files too.


## Pages'08 and Pages'09

I have included an XSLT file (`pages08tohtml.xsl`) that will process the xml from Pages'08 and Pages'09 files to HTML. You can apply it to the
index.xml.gz in a Pages'08 file bundle (which is a directory) or the index.xml found within a Pages'09 file
(which is just a zip file).  For now I'll leave it as an exercise to write a wrapper script.
